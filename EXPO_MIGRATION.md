# Expo Migration Complete

This project has been successfully migrated from React Native CLI to Expo Managed Workflow.

## Changes Made

### Removed Files/Directories:
- `android/` directory (native Android code)
- `ios/` directory (native iOS code)
- `metro.config.js` (Metro bundler config)
- `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` (Ruby dependencies)
- Old `babel.config.js` (replaced with Expo-compatible version)

### Updated Files:
- `package.json` - Updated with Expo dependencies and scripts
- `app.json` - Converted to Expo configuration
- `index.js` - Updated entry point for Expo
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated for Expo compatibility
- `babel.config.js` - New Expo-compatible Babel configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Updated for Expo testing

## New Scripts

- `npm start` or `yarn start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run android` or `yarn android` - Run on Android device/emulator
- `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` - Run on iOS device/simulator
- `npm run web` or `yarn web` - Run on web browser

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

3. Install Expo CLI globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/cli
   # or
   yarn global add @expo/cli
   ```

4. Run on device/emulator:
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
   - Or press 'a' for Android, 'i' for iOS in the terminal

## Benefits of Expo Managed Workflow

- No need to manage native code
- Over-the-air updates
- Easy deployment with EAS Build
